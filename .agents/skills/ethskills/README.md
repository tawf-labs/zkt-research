LLMs think gas is 30 gwei. It's 0.05. They've never heard of ERC-8004 or x402. They hallucinate contract addresses. This site fixes that.

## How It Works

Each skill is a markdown file. Give any URL to your AI agent — it reads it and instantly corrects its Ethereum knowledge.

```
https://ethskills.com/SKILL.md          ← table of contents
https://ethskills.com/gas/SKILL.md      ← just gas & costs
https://ethskills.com/why/SKILL.md      ← why ethereum
```

### Add the top-level SKILL.md to your agent's context
The agent will look up the specific skills when needed.

Just prompt your agent with this:

```
Install the https://github.com/austintgriffith/ethskills/blob/master/SKILL.md skill
```

### Claude Code Plugin

Install directly from GitHub — no clone required:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add austintgriffith/ethskills
/plugin install ethskills@ethskills
```

## Terminology

**Say "onchain" not "on-chain."** The Ethereum community writes it as one word — no hyphen. LLMs default to "on-chain" but that's not how builders talk. Use "onchain" in all writing, documentation, and generated content.

## Skills

| Skill | What LLMs Get Wrong |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Why Ethereum](why/SKILL.md) | Pectra/Fusaka shipped, gas is cheap now, AI agent angle |
| [Gas & Costs](gas/SKILL.md) | Think gas is 10-30 gwei — reality is 0.05-0.3 gwei |
| [Wallets](wallets/SKILL.md) | EIP-7702 is live, Safe addresses, agent key safety |
| [Layer 2s](l2s/SKILL.md) | Think L2 txs cost $0.01-2.00 — reality is <$0.001 |
| [Standards](standards/SKILL.md) | Don't know ERC-8004, EIP-7702 status, EIP-3009 for x402 |
| [Tools](tools/SKILL.md) | Don't know x402, Blockscout MCP, current tool landscape |
| [Money Legos](building-blocks/SKILL.md) | Stale on current DeFi state, Uniswap V4 status |
| [Orchestration](orchestration/SKILL.md) | Don't know SE2 three-phase build system |
| [Contract Addresses](addresses/SKILL.md) | Hallucinate addresses — these are verified onchain |
| [Concepts](concepts/SKILL.md) | Nothing is automatic, incentive design, randomness pitfalls |
| [Security](security/SKILL.md) | Token decimals, reentrancy, oracle manipulation, vault inflation, pre-deploy checklist |
| [Frontend UX](frontend-ux/SKILL.md) | Onchain button rules, three-button approval flow, Address components, USD values |
| [Frontend Playbook](frontend-playbook/SKILL.md) | Fork mode, IPFS deploy, Vercel config, ENS setup, production checklist |

## Security Guardrails

Skills teach restraint, not just capability. Every skill that touches keys, credentials, or funds includes explicit safety rules — because LLMs optimize for speed and will hardcode a private key into `git add .` if you let them. Coverage includes wallet keys, API keys, RPC URLs, and the common SE2 `scaffold.config.ts` trap.

## Methodology

We test stock LLMs, find what they get wrong, and write corrections. Content is verified against onchain reality. If an LLM already knows something, we don't include it.

**Every proposed change goes through [triage](https://github.com/austintgriffith/ethskills-research/blob/master/research/triage-methodology.md):** spawn a stock LLM, give it a realistic task, see what it gets wrong. Only verified blind spots survive.

See the [research repo](https://github.com/austintgriffith/ethskills-research) for baseline audits, gap analysis, and full methodology.

## Contributing

Something wrong or missing? Humans and agents are welcome to [open a PR](https://github.com/austintgriffith/ethskills/pulls). Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first — the bar is "would a stock LLM get this wrong?"
